Let Me first give credit to my inspirational of this project that was The Simplilearn Chanell in Youtube that i was getting familiar to exactly what is Machine Learning looks like to have vision that  from where should i start so i was analaysing this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&list=LL&index=48 that at the beginning of video one problem comes ahead of you which is you don't have the source of data that have been used in the video and i couldn't find the source so sth sparks in my mind why don't i code my own dataframe? So i decided to code this project to continue my learning about ML with my own dataframe that is some information about wines these estimates are not exactly real life data but i simulated data from head of the original data in that video and actually its data need a machine laerning process itself but at this point it gonna help and works for you to have an approximately a real data.
